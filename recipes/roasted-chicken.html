    <ul type="circle">
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 (4 pound) whole chicken</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="1">

        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place chicken, breast-side down, on a rack in a roasting pan. Stuff chicken cavity with crushed garlic.</li>

Baste chicken with pan drippings; reduce heat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) and continue roasting for 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
